Intro

	Reuse:
		mapping
		migrations
		change tracking
	Other problems:

		Static typization

ADO.NET

	Run Ado.Net test
	What's wrong?
		DB Schema
		No mappings
		Query as string (no validation)
		A lot of useless code

	ORM - Object-Relational Mapping
	Pros: simple, reusable, additional features
	Cons: additional difficulties, hard to write complicated query properly

	Required dependencies
		Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore

	Delete current DB
	dotnet ef
		say about .Design packages
	dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate
	dotnet ef migrations	
	dotnet ef database update
		it's took connection string from config/code
